::::::{dropdown} What is Awkward Array for? How does it compare to other libraries?

Python's builtin lists, dicts, and classes can be used to analyze arbitrary data structures, but at a cost in speed and memory. Therefore, they can't be used (easily) with large datasets.

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames (as well as [Polars](https://pola.rs/), [cuDF](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/), and [Dask DataFrame](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/dataframe.html)) are well-suited to tabular data, including tables with relational indexes, but not arbitrary data structures. If a DataFrame is filled with Python's builtin types, then it offers no speed or memory advantage over Python itself.

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is ideal for rectangular arrays of numbers, but not arbitrary data structures. If a NumPy array is filled with Python's builtin types, then it offers no speed or memory advantage over Python itself.

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) ([pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/)) manages arrays of arbitrary data structures (including those in [Polars](https://pola.rs/), [cuDF](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/), and to some extent, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)), with great language interoperability and interprocess communication, but without manipulation functions oriented toward data analysts.

Awkward Array is a data analyst-friendly extension of NumPy-like idioms for arbitrary data structures. It is intended to be used interchangeably with NumPy and share data with Arrow and DataFrames. Like NumPy, it simplifies and accelerates computations that transform arrays into arraysâ€”all computations over elements in an array are compiled. Also like NumPy, imperative-style computations can be accelerated with [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/).

Note that there is also a [ragged](https://github.com/scikit-hep/ragged) array library with simpler (but still non-rectangular) data types that more closely adheres to [array APIs](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/API_specification).

::::::{dropdown} Where is an Awkward Array's `shape` and `dtype`?

Since Awkward Arrays can contain arbitrary data structures, their type can't be separated into a `shape` and a `dtype`, the way a NumPy array can.

For an array of records like

```python
import awkward as ak

array = ak.Array([
    [{"x": 1.1, "y": [1]}, {"x": 2.2, "y": [1, 2]}, {"x": 3.3, "y": [1, 2, 3]}],
    [],
    [{"x": 4.4, "y": [1, 2, 3, 4]}, {"x": 5.5, "y": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}]
])
```

the `x` field contains floating point numbers and the `y` field contains lists of integers. They would have different `dtypes`, as well as different numbers of dimensions. This array also can't be separated into `x` and `y` columns with different `dtypes`, as in a DataFrame, since both fields are inside of records in a variable-length list.

Instead, Awkward Arrays have a `type`, which looks like

```python
3 * var * {x: float64, y: var * int64}
```

for the above. This combines `shape` and `dtype` information in the following way: the length of the array is `3`, the first dimension has `var` or variable length, it contains records with `x` and `y` field names in `{` `}`, the `x` field has `float64` primitive type and the `y` field is a `var` variable length list of `int64`. You can `print(array.type)` or `array.type.show()` to see the type of any `array`.

See the [ragged](https://github.com/scikit-hep/ragged) array library for variable-length dimensions that are nevertheless separable into a `shape` and `dtype`, like a conventional array.
