Awkward Array is a library for **nested, variable-sized data**, including arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, using **NumPy-like idioms**.

Arrays are **dynamically typed**, but operations on them are **compiled and fast**. Their behavior coincides with NumPy when array dimensions are regular and generalizes when they’re not.

Installation
------------

Awkward Array can be installed [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/awkward1/) using pip:

```bash
pip install awkward1
```

Most users will get a precompiled binary (wheel) for your operating system and Python version. If not, the above attempts to compile from source.

Getting help
------------

Report bugs, request features, and ask for additional documentation on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues). If you have a general "How do I…?" question, we'll answer it as a new example on this site.

If you have a problem that's too specific to be new documentation or it isn't exclusively related to Awkward Array, it might be more appropriate to ask on [StackOverflow with the [awkward-array] tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/awkward-array). Be sure to include tags for any other libraries that you use, such as Pandas or PyTorch.

The [Gitter Scikit-HEP/community](https://gitter.im/Scikit-HEP/community) is a way to get in touch with all Scikit-HEP developers and users.
