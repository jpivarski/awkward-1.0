How to reduce dimensions (sum/min/any/all)
==========================================

**This is a stub:** I intend to write this article, but haven't yet.

If you need it soon, create an issue saying so and I'll make it a higher priority.

The text of your issue doesn't have to be much more than a link to this page, so I can be sure which page you're referring to. If you add details about how and why you need it, however, I may be able to tailor the text to help you more.
