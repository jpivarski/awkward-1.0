What is an Awkward Array?
=========================

Arrays are fundamental to computing, and libraries like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) make it easy to work with arrays interactively.

Traditional arrays are rectilinear—tables in two dimensions or tensors in more—but real datasets are a bit more awkward. Complex data structures are more often represented with [JSON](https://www.json.org/).

Arrays are generally faster to use in mathematical computing, but awkwardly shaped data must somehow be flattened into a rectilinear shape 





```{code-cell}
print("hello")
```
