Awkward Array is a library for **nested, variable-sized data**, including arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, using **NumPy-like idioms**.

Arrays are **dynamically typed**, but operations on them are **compiled and fast**. Their behavior coincides with NumPy when array dimensions are regular and generalizes when they‚Äôre not.

Quickstart
==========

Use the left-bar for tutorials (‚â° button on mobile), click below for reference documentation, or [here for GitHub](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0). Note that the most complete documentation can be found in the {doc}`api-reference`: each function has a thorough docstring, usually with examples. Documentation for the compiled portion of Awkward Array can be found in the [C++ API Reference](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/index.html). User Guides can be found in {doc}`user-guide`.

Installation
------------

Awkward Array can be installed [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/awkward/) using pip:

```bash
pip install awkward
```

Most users will get a precompiled binary (wheel) for your operating system and Python version. If not, the above attempts to compile from source.

Getting help
------------

   * Report bugs, request features, and ask for additional documentation on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues).
   * You can vote for issues by adding a "thumbs up" (üëç) using the "smile/pick your reaction" menu on the top-right of the issue. See the [prioritized list of open issues](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+reactions%3A%3E0+).
   * If you have a "How do I...?" question, start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/discussions) with category "Q&A".
   * Alternatively, ask about it on [StackOverflow with the [awkward-array] tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/awkward-array). Be sure to include tags for any other libraries that you use, such as Pandas or PyTorch.
   * To ask questions in real time, try the Gitter [Scikit-HEP/awkward-array](https://gitter.im/Scikit-HEP/awkward-array) chat room.
