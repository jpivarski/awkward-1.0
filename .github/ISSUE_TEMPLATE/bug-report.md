Thank you for submitting an issue! (I know that it takes time and effort to do so.)

Note that we'll be closing the issue as soon as a solution is proposed. This is not meant to be unfriendly; it's for our own bookkeeping. If you think the first answer/solution is unsatisfactory, please do continue the thread and we'll reopen it or otherwise address it.

It may be necessary to include data that reproduces the bug, as a file if necessary but preferably a minimal `ak.Array` constructor.
